Week 5 Session 2

This session had a focus on project work with the Milestone 1 deadline almost upon us. For the most part I have my webside at a satisfactory point
with routes working to move between pages. What I am currently working on is the documentation. I still have personas and my site structure 
navigation to complete, as well as a need to redo my wireframes as since I last did them I have made quite a few changes to how I want my site to end up.

Beyond this there is not much to add for this particular journal entry except to say that my project is coming along nicely and will easily be finished 
by the deadline.
