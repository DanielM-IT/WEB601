Week 5 Session 1

This mornings class has a focus on understanding routes. 
To begin with we broke down a URL address to understand each of its components.
Below is a break down of an example YouTube URL.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj83cwfOF3Y

https:// = this defines the protocol

www. = this is the sub domain

youtube.com = this is the host, it can additionally be entered as an IP address instead of host name if it is known.

watch = path

?v=hj83cwfOF3Y = query string. These start with the ? and are separated by & if it is needed.

if there is a # this if called the fragment i.e. #history

if I was using a local host URL, for example: http://localhost:3000/home then

 localhost = this specifies that my machine is the host

 3000 = this is the port number being used


Following this we moved onto http request methods. These are 'get' and 'post'.
