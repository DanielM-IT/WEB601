# Week 15: Session 2

Today is the last official class of the semester. Even then we haven't dropped the pace as this afternoon is being spent covering Thunk which is a middleware that is used with our React-Redux.
To learn it we have been given an exercise which requires us to follow instructions to create a mini app using Thunk and React-redux. Thunk I have learned is middleware and serves to allow one function to return another function.
The application that I have created following the tutorial is one which allows the user to enter their GitHub username into the input box and retrieve their name, portrait, bio, location, follows and followers.
