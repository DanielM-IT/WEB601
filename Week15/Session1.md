# Week 15: Session 1

This morning we are looking at how to wire Redux into our React components. To do this we will be following along with our tutor in building a basic book app which uses Redux to show books and change their state.

The below depiction gives and idea of the libraries. The libraries from both React and Redux are imported and then combined to manage the state within the application.

   React

    v |
 React-redux

   Redux






   For homework we have been asked to do a simple app project that starts with the state of a number at 0. We should then be able to increment or deincrement by 1. This project will use the combined react-redux that we used in class to make it work.
