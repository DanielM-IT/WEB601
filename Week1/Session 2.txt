Session 1 & 2 

These sessions have proved to be highly interesting and informative. As a class we are being introduced to a website called Github. 
This is something I have heard a lot about but never actually looked into. 
It is an open source repository where members of the IT community can develop and work on both their own and other members projects. 
A person can work on many projects through Github and over time
build up quite an immpressive profile/portfolio over time. To the point that in many cases it becomes a person CV when job hunting in 
the IT industry.
