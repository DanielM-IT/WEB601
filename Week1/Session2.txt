Week 1 Session 2 

This session as proven to be highly interesting and informative. As a class we are being introduced to a website called Github. This is 
something I have heard a lot about but never actually looked into. It is an open source repository where members of the IT community can 
develop and work on both their own project and other members projects. 
A person can work on many projects through Github and over time build up quite an immpressive profile/portfolio. To the point that in 
many cases it can become a CV while job hunting in the IT industry. We have just been informed that all journal entries will be made using 
github so we get the extra practice using it. I personally think this is a brilliant strategy and am well on board with this. 

Beyond this in class we have been show a program called Visual Studio code. Through the terminal contain within it I will be running 
multiple git commands to clone my projects off the online github and onto my machine. After finishing my work these projects are then 
commited and pushed back to github to update my online version of a project. This is all done through using the various basic git commands
within the Visual Studio Code terminal.

To ensure that I begin to memorize all the different commands I will be sending projects I am working on in other classes to my git 
repository in addition ot continuing these journal entries. I will also be sending past projects from my time here at NMIT to github so I 
have old materials to reference when I need to.
