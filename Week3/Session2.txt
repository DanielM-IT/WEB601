Week 3 Session 2

Up this morning is Boolean logic. This covers things such as true and false, and logical operators.

Logical operators use the following:

|| = or 
&& = and
!  = not

These can be combined with conditions to decide whether a the result will be true or false. The result will change 
depending on what operators are used and in what order.

Logical operators can quickly be worked out if a set of 'Truth Tables' are kept on hand. These allow a user to quickly 
work out whether an output will be true or false and include the following tables:

- Negation
- Conjunction
- Disjunction
- Implication
- Bicondition


Afterware we moved onto functions which as it turns out is quite an important topic as most projects will 
most likely orient around the use of functions.

So far I am finding functions very easy to understand as they seem to function the same way as database functions
and this is something I did very well on last semester.
The function is first declared using its reserved word and then given a name followed by parentheses. The function
may then be called at the end by using the functions name along with its parentheses. Inside the functions 
parenthesis can be placed the input. This is just a placeholder and will only come into play when the function is 
called along with an input value. 
What I found extremely interesting was that our tutor explained the concepts of global execution and local execution 
threads. The global execution threads stores values held by variables while the local execution thread stores function 
variables. The function does not have a value. Instead it accepts an input upon it being called and from this input 
returns an output result.

We were aditionally introdusted to 'CallStack'. This is a way of storing memory in a stack. Basically, it means it is 
worked on like any other stack... from the top. In other words last in first out.
