Week 3 Session 1

In class time we achieved two things. The first is to cover mathematical operators in JavaScript and the second
was each team doing a quick class presentation on their project progress.

For the presentation each team is to explain what their project is how they organised each members work and how 
communication is done to avoid too much confusion. For my team we used Slack which we found to be highly effective.

As for the mathematical operators in JavaScript, I found these very easy to understand as they work in ths same way 
mathematical operators in database as well as standard algebra from my school years.
For instance operators in parantheses get worked on first, multiplication and division operators before addition and 
subtraction, operators of equal importance worked on from left to right, etc.


I am still working my way through html and css in Codecademy currently. I am finding that they are taking a while 
as it has been two years since I last did any web development so I have forgotten quite a bit plus I am encountering 
quite a lot of code keywords which were not covered or used in that web class. One thing I am doing is adding all my 
completed Codecademy work to one of my Github repositories. This will give me a code reference I can review at any 
future date if I forget anything or need a point of reference.
