# Week 10: Session 1

Due to being laid low by sickness I was unable to attend class this session. However, in between sleeping I have been trying my hand at understanding server-side
and client-side rendering of the api's to send and retrieve data from a database. 
Honestly, this is not going well. I feel I am getting nowhere with understanding how it works. It didn't seem too hard following the example we created in class. 
However, trying to add it to my project seems to be far trickier and I am getting nowhere. I am seriously going to have to sit down with my tutor for some extra 
coaching when I am better to try and get a handle on how all this section of connecting between the front and back ends work.
