# Week 9: Session 2

This session is about setting up restful api's through express. And oh my there is a lot to take in. It is intended as a continuation of last session where this time 
we are setting up our server and creating http requests which is then tested through a program called 'Postman'. 













At the end of the session I dont feel that I completely understand what to do but as I continue to look into over the weekend I am hoping that this will change.
I think the problem is just the sheer volume of code that needs to be learned. As I mentioned in an earlier entry that I am slow to learn code but proficient 
when in it when I do and this is no exception. I believe I am going to have to sink quite a few hours into restful api's to understand them enough to use in my projects.


As a side note. I have just learned of a file type called .md which will enable me to format the text in my entries. This I will be doing to all past entries, creating 
headers, unordered lists, etc.
