Week 4 Session 1

This morning began with a explanation of the communications between a web application and the server that provides
it. This topic I found to be very beneficial as my knowledge on the communications between web browsers and servers
is lacking. What I had not realised though in hindsight it makes sense is that server componants use codign languages.
Primarily C/C++. This can create an issue it would seem as packets are sent from a web app which will be in html, css, 
and java script. Due to the difference in languages the server will not be able to read the incoming packets thus this 
is where Node.js comes into the picture.

Node.js is a platform environment designed to allow Java Script to be executed outside of a web browser.
