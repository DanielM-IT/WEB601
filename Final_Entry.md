# Post Documentation Entry for Milestone 3

## Responsiveness
For the most part most things work quite well on a tablet sized device. However, the song cards are being an issue which I dont think I am going to solve with out removing Bootstrap and essentially redoing my navbar and footer as a result.

## Client and Server Functionality
Both of these work fantasically. Instructions for getting both running have been provided in the ReadMe as well as how to set up and populate a MySQL database with the same data.

## Redux
Actions, store and Reducers have all been set up and work for registering a new account with my website. I decided not to do any more as I will probably do react hooks instead for any forther development on the state of my application.

## Login 
For this I haven't managed to complete yet. I do have react-google-login working and can access the data through the inspector console. My next step I would like to achieve is to use react hooks to retrieve and pass this data as I have just seen on a video.


# Future Improvements and Fixes
- Social Media Icons need links added.
- Site logo and title needs a glow or something to make it easier to e read for the user.
- Would like to still learn to set up the login through local storage + token in addition to the google login.
- Need to pass account data to edit account page to be editable by the user.
- Would like to remove bootstrap and improving the responsive design through media queries.
- Browse music needs to have category pages added to filter music.
