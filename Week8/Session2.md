# Week 8: Session 2

This mornings session is all about two things. First we will be learning to contribute to another github project and following this each of the teams will be presenting the thundertalks I mentioned in previous entries. Milton and I have worked hard over the last couple of days to create a good presentation for this.

Lets start with the contributions. For this I was unable to do much as I am currently borrowing my brothers computer which does not have any of the need software on it so I was unable to participate as I would have liked. However, as usual I was taking notes which I can refer to later on if need be.

The presentation went very well. What I think I esspecially liked was how we judged each teams performance and gave feedback. This I think is great for us to know what needs working on for us to become proficient at being able to give well constructed talks.

Milton and I gained very good feedback on our slides and presentation which I expect was due to us using the knowledge taught in our prior communications class. We did get negative feedback in that we should have had some code examples though in our defence we had not realised that this was required and I felt that if we went too deep into each part of the stack we would lose our focus which was intended to be on the full stack itself.
