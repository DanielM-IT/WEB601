# Week 12: Session 1

Today has been set aside for each student having a 5 minute sit down with our tutor to show what our website can do; that it does what is required of it for milestone two. As I am up to date in this class I filled in the time while waiting for my turn by working on another classes assignment which is due in under a week. 
When my turn came I did indeed tick all the boxes so to speak. I have all my requests working as they should as well as the correct data being retrieved from my database. What I have now been guided on as to a good direction to go next is to work on finishing my navbar, footer and some other CSS visuals. I will also need to continue working on the the responsive desin for my website so that it is friendly for mobile devices in addition to computers. 
These things I plan on doing at the beginning of next week as I was one of the three students chosen by my tutor to show case my application at one of his monthly meetups and will need to get most of these things finish so as to give my website a bit more of a polished look in addition to the functionality which I have been mostly focusing on up until now.
